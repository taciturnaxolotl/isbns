## What's this?

I recently saw the Annie's archive bounty for ISBN visualization. I definetly don't think I could win the 10k prize but it was an interesting topic I decided to try and make a video visualization of how ISBNs work. Also I just realllllly wanted to play with [MotionCanvas](https://motioncanvas.io) ^-^

## Why that License?

Because free as in information!!! If you are curious about using my work here commercially, please reach out to me and we can discuss it. I'm not a monster, I just want to know what you're doing with it and maybe get a little bit of money for my time.
